# MinecraftAttempt
I am trying reproduce some aspects of Minecraft in Unity, with a focus on survival.

Here are my goals.
- [x] Initialize repository and Unity project
- [x] Create a Block class with 6 faces
- [x] Make a Chunk system that generates a flat surface of blocks and a basic first-person controller
- [x] Disable faces of Blocks that are not exposed to air
- [x] Reduce lag when changing chunks
- [x] Highlight the Block that the cursor is touching
- [x] Click to break Blocks
- [ ] Make Blocks droppable and pick-upable.
- [x] Right click to place blocks
- [x] Add unbreakable block layer at the bottom
- [x] Simple terrain
- [ ] Add basic hostile mobs
- [ ] Spawning algorithm for mobs
- [ ] Left click to attack mobs
- [ ] Health bar and damage from mobs
- [ ] Regeneration over time
- [ ] Holding shift to sneak
- [ ] Light sources
